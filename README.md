# Deep Learning Grid Search

In this project, we will learn how to use the scikit-learn grid search capability.

We are going to learn the following topics:

How to use Keras models in scikit-learn.
How to use grid search in scikit-learn.
How to tune batch size and training epochs.
How to tune learning rate
How to tune network weight initialization.
How to tune activation functions.
How to tune dropout regularization.
How to tune the number of neurons in the hidden layer.
